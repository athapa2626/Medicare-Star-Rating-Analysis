"In light of recent court decisions, CMS has recalculated the 2024 Star Ratings to address the application of Tukey outlier deletion and guardrails as codified at 42 C.F.R. §§ 422.166(a)(2)(i) and 423.186(a)(2)(i). Specifically, we have recalculated the 2024 Star Ratings using the published 2023 Star Ratings cut points to determine the guardrails for the 2024 Star Ratings (i.e., Tukey outliers were not removed from the 2023 Star Ratings). We have assigned all contracts the recalculated 2024 overall and/or summary Star Ratings if those recalculated ratings result in higher ratings than what was previously assigned based on the contract’s overall and/or summary 2024 Star Ratings that were released in October 2023.
