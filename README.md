# Medicare Advantage Star Ratings Impact Analysis

*Identifying high-impact quality measures to help Medicare Advantage plans unlock $100M+ in annual bonus payments*

---

## Project Overview

**Business Problem:** 141 Medicare Advantage health plans are rated at 3.5 stars—just 0.5 stars away from eligibility for Quality Bonus Payments worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually. This project analyzes CMS Star Ratings data to identify which specific quality measures these plans should prioritize to maximize their rating improvement.

**Key Question:** *With limited resources, which measures offer the highest ROI for improving overall star ratings?*

**Impact:** CMS distributes ~$11 billion annually in bonus payments to 4+ star plans. Strategic focus on 2-3 high-weight measures could move plans from 3.5 to 4.0 stars within 12-18 months.

## Business Context

### The Medicare Advantage Star Ratings System

Medicare Advantage plans are rated 1-5 stars based on ~42 quality measures across:
- **Clinical Outcomes** (e.g., hospital readmissions, diabetes control) - *Weight: 3x*
- **Patient Experience** (CAHPS surveys) - *Weight: 1.5-4x*
- **Access & Service** (call centers, appeals) - *Weight: 1x*
- **Medication Adherence** (Part D measures) - *Weight: 3x*

### Why Star Ratings Matter

| Star Rating | Bonus Payment | Member Impact |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **5.0 stars** | 5% bonus | "High performing" icon on Medicare.gov |
| **4.0-4.5 stars** | 5% bonus | Eligible for rebates & benefits |
| **3.5 stars** | No bonus | Just below threshold |
| **≤ 3.0 stars** | No bonus | "Low performing" if consistent |

**The Opportunity:** 141 plans at 3.5 stars represent $billions in unrealized bonus payments.

## Key Findings

### 1. The Near-Bonus Opportunity is Massive
- **141 plans (26%)** are stuck at 3.5 stars
- Collectively serve millions of Medicare beneficiaries
- Missing out on hundreds of millions in bonus payments
- Most are just **2-3 measure improvements** away from 4.0 stars

### 2. High-Impact Measures Drive Disproportionate Value

**Top 3 Improvement Opportunities:**

| Measure ID | Measure Name | Avg Score | Weight | Improvement Potential |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| **C15** | All-Cause Readmissions | 2.04 | 3x | **5.89** |
| **C16** | Statin Therapy (CVD) | 2.25 | 3x | **5.25** |
| **D10** | Cholesterol Medication Adherence | 2.32 | 3x | **5.03** |

**Insight:** These triple-weighted measures offer **3x more impact** per point improvement than standard measures.

### 3. Clinical Outcomes vs. Operational Excellence

**Where plans excel:**
- Call center accessibility (4.48 avg)
- Customer service (4.43 avg)
- Administrative processes (4.30+ avg)

**Where plans struggle:**
- Hospital readmissions (2.04 avg)
- Medication adherence (2.32-2.66 avg)
- Care transitions (2.17 avg)

**Strategic Insight:** The path to 4 stars runs through clinical effectiveness, not operational efficiency.

### 4. Improvement is Achievable

High variance in measure scores proves excellence is possible:
- Readmissions: Some 3.5-star plans score 4.0+
- Medication adherence: Ranges from 2.0 to 4.0 stars among similar plans
- **Takeaway:** This is about adopting best practices, not doing the impossible

## Business Recommendations

### For 3.5-Star Plans: Fast Track to 4 Stars

**Phase 1: Attack Triple-Weighted Measures (Months 1-6)**

Focus on **3 high-ROI measures:**

1. **Reduce Readmissions (C15)** → Target: 2.0 → 3.5 stars
   - Implement 72-hour post-discharge calls
   - Medication reconciliation programs
   - Care transition teams

2. **Improve Cholesterol Medication Adherence (D10)** → Target: 2.3 → 3.5 stars
   - Automated refill reminders
   - 90-day prescriptions
   - Pharmacist outreach programs

3. **Boost Statin Therapy (C16)** → Target: 2.25 → 3.5 stars
   - Provider clinical decision support
   - Patient education materials
   - Standing orders protocols

**Expected Impact:** Moving these 3 measures could increase overall rating by 0.4-0.6 stars

**Phase 2: Quick Wins on Patient Experience (Months 3-9)**
- Reduce call wait times (C21)
- Improve appointment access (C20)
- Enhance member communications (C23)

### ROI Analysis

**Investment:** $5-15M (care coordination, technology, training)  
**Return:** $100-300M annual bonus payments  
**ROI:** **10-60x in year 1**, continuing indefinitely
