# Medicare Advantage Star Ratings Impact Analysis

*Identifying high-impact quality measures to help Medicare Advantage plans unlock $100M+ in annual bonus payments*

---

## Project Overview

**Business Problem:** 141 Medicare Advantage health plans are rated at 3.5 stars—just 0.5 stars away from eligibility for Quality Bonus Payments worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually. This project analyzes CMS Star Ratings data to identify which specific quality measures these plans should prioritize to maximize their rating improvement.

**Key Question:** *With limited resources, which measures offer the highest ROI for improving overall star ratings?*

**Impact:** CMS distributes ~$11 billion annually in bonus payments to 4+ star plans. Strategic focus on 2-3 high-weight measures could move plans from 3.5 to 4.0 stars within 12-18 months.

## Business Context

### The Medicare Advantage Star Ratings System

Medicare Advantage plans are rated 1-5 stars based on ~42 quality measures across:
- **Clinical Outcomes** (e.g., hospital readmissions, diabetes control) - *Weight: 3x*
- **Patient Experience** (CAHPS surveys) - *Weight: 1.5-4x*
- **Access & Service** (call centers, appeals) - *Weight: 1x*
- **Medication Adherence** (Part D measures) - *Weight: 3x*

### Why Star Ratings Matter

| Star Rating | Bonus Payment | Member Impact |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **5.0 stars** | 5% bonus | "High performing" icon on Medicare.gov |
| **4.0-4.5 stars** | 5% bonus | Eligible for rebates & benefits |
| **3.5 stars** | No bonus | Just below threshold |
| **≤ 3.0 stars** | No bonus | "Low performing" if consistent |

**The Opportunity:** 141 plans at 3.5 stars represent $billions in unrealized bonus payments.
